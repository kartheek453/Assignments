# Responsive Webpage with Collapsible Menu

This is a responsive webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a fixed navbar, a collapsible left menu, a right panel, and a footer. The layout is designed to be user-friendly and functional across different screen sizes.

## Features

- **Fixed Navbar**: A fixed navigation bar at the top of the page that does not move when scrolling.
- **Collapsible Left Menu**: A menu that lists all sections (Home, About, Services, Contact). The left menu is collapsible for smaller screens.
- **Main Content Area**: The main content area is responsive and adjusts based on the available space.
- **Right Panel**: A right panel that can be used for additional content such as advertisements or links.
- **Footer**: A footer at the bottom of the page with copyright information.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Page Scaling**: The page scales dynamically based on the screen width using JavaScript to adjust the page size.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the layout and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive features like the collapsible left menu and page scaling.
- **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive grid layout and styling.

- The **main content area** adapts to the screen size and is centered on the page.
- The **right panel** holds additional content that can be customized or used for ads.
- The **footer** stays at the bottom of the page, with copyright details.
- The **JavaScript function** `adjustPageScale()` adjusts the page's scale based on the current screen width, making the page shrink or enlarge accordingly.
